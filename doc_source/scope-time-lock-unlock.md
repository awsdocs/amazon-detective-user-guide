# Locking or unlocking the scope time<a name="scope-time-lock-unlock"></a>

By default, the scope time is unlocked\. That means that when you navigate to a different profile, the scope time is changed to the default for that profile\. On finding profiles, the scope time is based on the start and end time associated with the suspicious activity\. If you then pivot to an entity profile, the scope time changes to the previous 24 hours\.

If the scope time is locked, then the current scope time remains in place as you navigate to different profiles\. When you pivot from a finding profile to an entity profile, you see the activity that occurred while the finding was observed\.

To see and control whether the scope time is currently locked, under **Scope time**, use **Lock**\. When you edit the scope time, the **Lock** setting is also available on the **Edit scope time** panel\.
