# Pivoting from a profile panel to another entity profile<a name="profile-panel-pivot"></a>

When a profile panel contains an identifier of a different entity, it is usually a link to that entity profile\. The exceptions are the links to the Amazon EC2 and IAM consoles on the EC2 instance, AWS user, and AWS role profiles\. See [Pivoting from a profile panel to another console](profile-panel-console-links.md)\.

For example, from a list of IP addresses, you might be able to display the profile for a specific IP address\. That way you can see if there is any other information available to help you to complete your investigation\.
