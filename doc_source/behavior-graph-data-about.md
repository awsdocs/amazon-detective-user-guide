# Data in a behavior graph<a name="behavior-graph-data-about"></a>

In Detective, you conduct investigations using data from a Detective behavior graph\.

A behavior graph is a linked set of data generated from the Detective source data that is ingested from one or more Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) accounts\.

The behavior graph uses the source data to do the following:
+ Generate an overall picture of your systems, users, and the interactions among them over time
+ Perform more detailed analysis of specific activity to help you answer specific questions that arise as you conduct investigations

Note that all extraction, modeling, and analytics of behavior graph data occurs within the context of each individual behavior graph\.

For information about how an administrator account manages the member accounts in a behavior graph, see [Managing accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/accounts.html) in *Detective Administration Guide*\.
