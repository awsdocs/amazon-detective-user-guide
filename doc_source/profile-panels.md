# Viewing and interacting with profile panels<a name="profile-panels"></a>

Each entity profile on the Amazon Detective console consists of a set of profile panels\. A profile panel is a visualization that provides general details or highlights specific activity associated with an entity\. Profile panels use different types of visualizations to present different types of information\. They can also provide links to additional details or to other profiles\.

Each profile panel is intended to help analysts find answers to specific questions about entities and their associated activity\. The answers to those questions help lead to a conclusion about whether the activity represents a genuine threat\.
