The Splunk Trumpet project allows you send data from AWS services to Splunk\.

You can configure the Trumpet project to generate Detective URLs for Amazon GuardDuty findings\. You can then use these URLs to pivot directly from Splunk to the corresponding Detective finding profiles\.

The Trumpet project is available from GitHub at [https://github\.com/splunk/splunk\-aws\-project\-trumpet](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-aws-project-trumpet)\.

On the configuration page for the Trumpet project, from **AWS CloudWatch Events**, choose **Detective GuardDuty URLs**\.
